# jekyll-relative-link-test

Testing the jekyll-realtive-links plugin

See [index.md](index.md) for a variety of links: without spaces, with spaces, with encoded spaces

See how they render at GH Pages [here](https://stevecopley.github.io/jekyll-relative-link-test/)

Note: 
- The link to a MD file that contains spaces (which is not rendered correctly in the MD view) correctly becomes a link to the HTML GH Pages page
- The link to a MD file that has the spaces encoded to %20 (rendered correctly in MD) does __not__ become a link to the HTML page - it remains a link to the MD file
